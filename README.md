Name: Fit Find Cornell 
Tagline : App for scheduling cornell gym spaces
Backend repo: https://github.com/Dariyn/hackchallenge
Short description: This application is designed to allow Cornell students to login in and reserve gym spaces. At Cornell it is often hard to find a space to play badminton or basketball since most of the gym spaces are usually packed. This app seeks to smoothen out this process by allowing userrs to pre reserve these spaces.

How the app fulfills requirments:
SwiftUI or AutoLayout using NSLayoutConstraint or SnapKit (no storyboards) - constraining all elements such as buttons labels etc
At least one UICollectionView, UITableView, or List (SwiftUI)- ui table view for gyms and ui table view for reservations
Some form of navigation to navigate between screens—push, present etc. - navigation between viewController and reservation screen, Login screen and viewController, and viewController and Bookings screen.
Integrate with your Backend’s API - this API must provide some meaningful value to your app - to be done 

Other comments: My frontend partner did not work on this project, they didnt even accept the github repo invite. All work was done by me. This caused me to not be efficient as I wanted. On top of this I only recieved working backend routes five hours before the submission deadline. This caused me to not be able to fully implement the networking portion of the app. However I did begin some networking which you will see commented out (as per Justin's suggestion).
