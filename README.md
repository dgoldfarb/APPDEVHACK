Name: Fit Find Cornell 
Tagline : App for scheduling cornell gym spaces
Backend repo:
Short description: This application is designed to allow Cornell students to login in and reserve gym spaces. At Cornell it is often hard to find a space to play badminton or basketball since most of the gym spaces are usually packed. This app seeks to smoothen out this process by allowing userrs to pre reserve these spaces.
ScreenShots: 
How the app fulfills requirments:
SwiftUI or AutoLayout using NSLayoutConstraint or SnapKit (no storyboards) - constraining all elements such as buttons labels etc
At least one UICollectionView, UITableView, or List (SwiftUI)- ui table view for gyms and ui table view for reservations
Some form of navigation to navigate between screens—push, present etc. - navigation between viewController and reservation screen, Login screen and viewController, and viewController and Bookings screen.
Integrate with your Backend’s API - this API must provide some meaningful value to your app - to be done
